Speeding up the Simulations of Stochastic Volatility Models for Applications in Financial Markets

In this code, a SV time series is generated, then analysed using a hybrid monte carlo method.

The statistical values obtained from the simulation are compared to the analytical values used to generate the time series.
These values being consistent shows that the simualtion is functional, and can be applied to real-world time series
